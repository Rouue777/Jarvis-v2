"Jarvis, bom dia" — replay the morning routine on demand.

The first launch of the day plays the morning track, greets, checks the
YouTube channel and reads the AI news; later launches only greet. This tool
lets the user ask for the full routine again at any time:

    "Jarvis, bom dia"          → handled locally when listening with Groq
                                 (never reaches the model); otherwise the
                                 model calls this tool.

Nothing to configure.
