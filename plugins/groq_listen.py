"""
Groq listening — settings form and a status tool.

This plugin exists for its PLUGIN_SETTINGS: it puts the Groq key, the Whisper
model and the language into ⚙ → PLUGIN SETTINGS → GROQ, with a TEST CONNECTION
button, without any edit to the core. The actual listening lives in
core/groq_stt.py and is switched on with the "LISTEN WITH" button in the ⚙
drawer (or "stt_engine": "groq" in config/api_keys.json).

Get a key at https://console.groq.com/keys (free tier is enough).
